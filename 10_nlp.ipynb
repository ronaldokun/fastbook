    "In <<chapter_intro>> we saw that deep learning can be used to get great results with natural language datasets. Our example relied on using a pretrained language model and fine-tuning it to classify those reviews. One thing is a bit different from the transfer learning we have in computer vision: the pretrained model was not trained on the same task as the model we used to classify reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call a language model is a model that has been trained to guess what the next word in a text is (having read the ones before). This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to get an understanding of the English-- or other--language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [Self-supervised learning and computer vision](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pre-training a model used for transfer learning."

    "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better: the Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English. So instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could finetune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and *then* use that as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targetting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of IMDb, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language that seen in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that with fastai, we can download a pre-trained language model for English, and use it to get state-of-the-art results for NLP classification. (We expect pre-trained models in many more languages to be available soon — they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. So that is 100,000 movie reviews altogether (since there are also 25,000 labelled reviews in the training set, and 25,000 in the validation set). We can use all 100,000 of these reviews to fine tune the pretrained language model — this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review. In contrast, the pretrained model was trained only on Wikipedia articles.\n",

    "The [ULMFiT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of language model fine tuning, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarised in <<ulmfit_process>>."

(A dedicated embedding matrix can take as inputs the raw vocab indexes created in step two; this is equivalent to, but faster and more efficient, than a matrix which takes as input one-hot encoded vectors representing the indexes)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do nearly the same thing with text! What is new is the idea of a sequence. First we concatenate all of the documents in our dataset into one big long string and split it into words, giving us a very long list of words. Our independent variable will be the sequence of words starting with the first word in our very long list and ending with the second last, and our dependent variable would be the sequence of words starting with the second word and ending with the last word. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating our vocab, we will have very common words that will probably be in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, but we will also have new words specific to our corpus (cinematographic terms, or actor names for instance). Our embedding matrix will be built accordingly: for words that are in the vocabulary of our pretrained model, we will take the corresponding row in the embedding matrix of this pretrained model; but for new words, we won't have anything, so we will just initialize the corresponding row with a random vector."
